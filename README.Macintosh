GLM macintosh version now has a GUI.

Building requires :

   1) XCode - available through the App Store
       NB you will also need the commandline tools for XCode

              xcode-select --install

   2) Since compiling with gfortran doesn't work, you will need Intel Fortran
   3) You will need netcdf - this is available from MacPorts - https://www.macports.org

             port install netcdf

      Or you can use Homebrew - http://brew.sh/

             brew install homebrew/science/netcdf

   4) To build the GUI you will need libgd - this is available through MacPorts

             port install gd2

      or through Homebrew

             brew install gd

   5) To build a version including FABM you will need cmake :

             port install cmake

       or

             brew install cmake

NB: The macpkg.sh script included defaults to use for MacPorts at the moment. To change
    to homebrew edit the GLM_CONFIG file
