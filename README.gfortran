# Notes 2013-11-26
#
# Compiling, at this stage, requires Intel Fortran as well as
# the C compilers.  Some effort has been put into making it
# compile with gfortran, however there is a show stopper bug :
#
#    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40737
#
# Actually, there is a second as yet unreported bug which
# causes the compiler to segfault, but there is a workaround.
# [see comments in glm_aed2.F90]
